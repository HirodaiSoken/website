Quantum Computers for Physicists

<!--more-->
Abstract:
Quantum computers were proposed in the early 1980s (Manin 1980, Benioff 1980, Feynman 1981). With the development and commercialization efforts by companies such as D-Wave in Canada and IBM in the United States, quantum computers have become more widespread in universities and other institutions across North America and Europe. In this lecture, I will briefly review the history of quantum computers and discuss how they can be utilized in the field of physics.
