General relativistic radiation MHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion flows onto a magnetized neutron star

<!--more-->
Abstract:
Gas accretion onto magnetized neutron stars exhibits a wide variety of observational signatures. To investigate the accretion physics around the neutron stars, a comparison between observations and numerical models is required. We have performed general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations of accretion flows around neutron stars with dipole and quadrupole magnetic fields. In our model, an accretion disk forms far from the neutron star, and outflows driven by powerful radiation forces emanate from the disk. Near the neutron star, accretion flows along the starâ€™s magnetic field lines also appear. In this talk, I show that our model can explain the observations and discuss the magnetic field structure of the neutron star.
