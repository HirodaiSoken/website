New techniques for ultra-light dark matter searches

<!--more-->
Abstract:
Ultra-light dark matter field oscillations in the late Universe imprint distinctive marks on interferometers and pulsar-timing data. These depend on the details of the dark matter model, for instance its spin and interactions with the Standard Model. In this talk I will review new techniques and methods to extract a putative ultra-light dark matter signal from gravitational wave detectors and pulsar-timing data. In particular, I will focus on (a) a bayesian method for populations of binary pulsars; (b) a machine-learning-based technique to extract the dark-matter signal from binary pulsar orbital perturbations; (c) the signatures of ultra-light dark matter on gravitational wave interferometer data. If time allows, I will also review recent results on simulations of halo formation with ultra-light dark matter of spin 0, 1 and 2.
