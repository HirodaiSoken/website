- Title:
Non-monotonic specific entropy on the transition line near the QCD critical point

<!--more-->
Abstract:
We study the effect of the QCD critical point on the isentropic trajectories in the QCD phase diagram. We point out that the universality of the critical equation of state (EOS) and the third law of thermodynamics dictates a non-monotonic behavior of specific entropy (per baryon) on at least one side of the coexistence line. We examine how the maximum depends on the critical EOS parameters commonly used in literature. Based on these findings, we classify how the isentropic trajectories in adiabatically expanding heavy-ion collision fireballs approach the QCD critical point or the coexistence line.
