Introduction to Quantum Computing:From  Fundamentals to Fluid Simulations

<!--more-->
Abstract:
Quantum computers, by effectively utilizing the principle of superposition in quantum mechanics, 
are believed to be able to perform certain calculations overwhelmingly faster than traditional computers. 
Currently, research and development aimed at solving practical problems with quantum computers are being 
extensively pursued across both academic and industrial sectors.
In this seminar, we will begin with an explanation of the principles of quantum computing, 
followed by an introduction to fundamental quantum algorithms and their typical applications. 
In particular, we will address the current state and prospects of algorithm research for fluid simulations, 
which are crucial in Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE).
