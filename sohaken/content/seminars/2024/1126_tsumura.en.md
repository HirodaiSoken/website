- Title:
The origin of Pseudo-Southern Goldstone boson dark matter

<!--more-->
Abstract:

Observations of the Universe through gravitational interactions have cast doubt on the existence of dark matter; WIMPs have been attractive candidates for thermally produced dark matter in the history of the Universe, but advances in direct detection experiments have made WIMPs without some mechanism difficult to achieve. Pseudo-Nanbu Goldstone boson dark matter is a dark matter candidate with such a mechanism, and in recent years work has been done to construct a complete UV model of it. In this talk I would like to present the UV-complete models proposed so far.
