- Title: 
Inflation and dark matter from a strongly interacting Hidden sector

<!--more-->

- Abstract:
Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in a QCD-like hidden sector is used to generate the Planck mass
and the electroweak scale including the heavy right-handed neutrino mass. A real scalar field transmits
the energy scale of the hidden sector to the visible sectors, playing a role of inflaton in the early Universe.
We discuss the inflationary dynamics in our model. Our dark matter candidates are hidden pions
that raise due to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. We also discuss the relic abundance of the dark matter,
which isproduced from the decay of inflaton.
