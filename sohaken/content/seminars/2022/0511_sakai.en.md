- Title:
Fluctuations in high-energy heavy-ion collisions

<!--more-->

- Abstract:
According to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the interaction among quarks and gluons become smaller at higher temperature due to asymptotic freedom, and the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is formed.
To investigate the properties of QGP, the high-energy heavy-ion collision experiments are performed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
One of the major discoveries at RHIC is the large magnitude of the elliptic flow.
The elliptic flow is understood by the results from hydrodynamic models.
For further understanding of the observables in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, event-by-event fluctuations have been playing an important role.
In this seminar, I talk about the time-space evolution of high-energy heavy-ion collisions and introduce the initial fluctuations and the hydrodynamic fluctuations.
Then I show the analysis of the effect of these fluctuations on observables.
