Nuclear equation of state and 208Pb

<!--more-->

- Abstract:
The neutron skin thickness could be crucial to constrain the nuclear equation of state (EoS). According to the phenomenological mean-field type studies, the neutron skin of 208Pb is known to be strongly correlated with the neutron star pressure, motivating neutron skin thickness measurements. From this background, it is important to test the correlation through the nuclear first principle calculation. In this talk, I will show the results for 208Pb and nuclear EoS parameters from the first principle calculation.
