Right-handed current, *B→X<sub>u</sub>lv* decays and non-trivial topology in QCD vacuum

<!--more-->
- Abstract:
We study violation of quark-hadron duality for *B→X<sub>u</sub>lv* decays in the presence of the right-handed current (RHC). In this case, it is shown that the fermionic zero mode of an intermediate light quark, which is induced by an instanton, gives a non-vanishing contribution owing to its chirality structure. Within a certain approximation relying on the single instanton, the finite distance singularity, causing violation of quark-hadron duality, is extracted analytically. As a result, it is shown that duality violation for the lepton energy distribution in *B→X<sub>u</sub>lv* decays is possibly comparable to the chirally-suppressed perturbative contribution in the RHC, for a particular region in the phase space.
