- Title: 
Lattice simulation for system with sign problem

<!--more-->

- Abstract:
Recently, several methods have been developed to overcome the sign problem, which appears in the system of a complex action and prevents us from a quantitative study by traditional Monte Carlo simulations. In this talk, I will explain our attempt especially for QCD at finite density and system with a complex coupling.
