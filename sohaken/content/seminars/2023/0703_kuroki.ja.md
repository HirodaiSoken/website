Phenomenology of high-energy nuclear collisions using relativistic hydrodynamic models

<!--more-->

- Abstract:
Dynamics of strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP) created transiently in high-energy nuclear collisions is well described by relativistic hydrodynamics. Phenomenological QCD studies using dynamical models including relativistic hydrodynamics have been actively conducted. In this seminar, I will begin by presenting the framework of relativistic hydrodynamics and its applicability to high-energy nuclear collisions, and briefly review the phenomenological approach based on Bayesian inference with hydrodynamics-based models. I will discuss mainly two related topics.

The first is the so-called "ultra-central flow puzzle". Anisotropic flow harmonics, which play crucial roles in extracting the transport properties of QGP, are well described by hydrodynamics-based models. However, no dynamical model has ever reproduced the experimental data in ultra-central collisions, where hydrodynamics is expected to work better. I will discuss the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations on anisotropic flow harmonics in ultra-central collisions.

The second is a phenomenological method known as "femtoscopy". By utilizing high-energy nuclear collisions as the hadron factory, femtoscopy is expected to precisely unravel the low-energy interactions between hadrons that are difficult in direct scattering experiments. I will outline the framework of femtoscopy and discuss the importance of hydrodynamics-based models in the analysis of femtoscopy.
