- Title:
Phase transitions and power-law correlations in active matter models

<!--more-->
Abstract:
 A crowd of self-propelled elements, ranging from birds to bacteria, is called active matter. Unique phase behaviors such as flocking and motility-induced phase separation appear in active matter. In this talk, I will first review phase transitions in active matter. Then, using a mapping to non-Hermitian quantum systems, I will show that power-law correlation of the particle density generically appears in minimal models of active matter. Lastly, extending the connection between active matter and quantum systems, I will discuss a quantum model of active matter that undergoes a flocking-like phase transition.
