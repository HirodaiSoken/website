Massive fermion between two parallel chiral plates

<!--more-->

- Abstract:
In this talk, I will present our study about the system of a massive fermion field confined between two parallel plates under chiral MIT boundary conditions. In this work, we investigate the effects of the chiral angle on the Casimir energy for a massive fermion field with the general momentum. We find that the Casimir energy as a function of the chiral angle is generally symmetric, and the attractive Casimir force in the chiral case is stronger than that in the nonchiral case. In addition, we also investigate the approximate Casimir energy for light and heavy mass cases, and the behavior of the discrete momentum and changes of spin orientation are also discussed.
