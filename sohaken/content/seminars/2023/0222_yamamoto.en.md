Phenomenological implication of flavor symmetry

<!--more-->
Abstract:
The electric and magnetic dipole moments of the electron and the muon are low-energy probes of New Physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM). The recent experimental measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon has indicated the discrepancy with the SM prediction. The long-standing muon g-2 anomaly might be a hint for new physics.

In this seminar, after brief review of U(2) flavor symmetry, I will discuss the interplay of NP among the lepton magnetic moment, the lepton flavor violation (LFV) and the electron electric dipole moment (EDM) in light of recent data of the muon g-2, in the SMEFT with the U(2) flavor symmetry.
