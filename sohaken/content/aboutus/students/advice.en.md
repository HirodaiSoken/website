Mainly advice for international students about what to study and the process for entering our group.
<!--more-->
Our group is a part of the Physics program in the Graduate School of Advanced Science and Engineering.
As such, you should refer to their [admission's page](https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/adse/admission) for the most recent information.
In addition, you can read about student life and experiences from the [Hiroshima University Student Vox Pop](https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/explore_hu/namanokoe), and there is general information about Hiroshima university from [Hiroshima University Prospectus.](https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en/koho_press/daigakuannai)

# For entering the Master's Course
We suggest having a strong background in the following subjects,
- special relativity
- analytical mechanics (Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics)
- quantum mechanics
- electromagnetism
- complex analysis methods
- numerical computation (for example: Mathematica, python, FORTRAN, C++)

and we suggest having a basic understanding of,
- general relativity
- quantum statistics
- group theory (Lie groups).

Many of those subjects should be covered as part of usual undergraduate studies in physics.
Additionally, we expect strong English or Japanese language skills.

If you are interested in joining as a Master's student, please contact a staff member on our [member's page](members/) by email based on your research area interests.
Then you can discuss the application guidelines either in person or online.
Also, for international students there are two opportunities to enter the graduate school, April and October.

# For entering the Doctoral Course
In addition to the background subjects for the Master's Course we suggest having a background in,
- quantum field theory
- path integral formulation of quantum theories
- non-equilibrium quantum statistics (non-equilibrium quantum field theory)
- elementary particle physics and the Standard Model

You should have strong English skills.

If you are interested in joining as a Doctoral student, please contact a staff member on our [member's page](members/) by email based on your research area interests.
Then you can discuss the application guidelines either in person or online.
Similar to the master's course, for international students there are two opportunities to enter the graduate school, April and October.

# Suggested readings and resources

For more readings we suggest using Professor Gerard ’t Hooft's website [how to become a GOOD theoretical physicist.](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/index.html)

# Important information for International Students
We strongly encourage International students to consider applying for Scholarships either through their home country or through Hiroshima University.
JASSO provides a listing of scholarships for International students [at this link.](https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/en/planning/by-style/pamphlet/index.html)
When you contact a staff member to discuss research please, also discuss scholarship information.

Hiroshima University, Higashi-hiroshima city, and the Japanese government have a lot of information about international life in Japan.
Some good resources are listed at the [student resource page もみじ.](https://momiji.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/momiji-top/en/international/campus-life.html)
