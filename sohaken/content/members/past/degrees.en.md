First we give the [Doctoral thesis]({{< relref path="/members/past/degrees.md#doctoral-thesis-by-school-year-conferred" >}}), then the [Master`s thesis]({{<  relref path="/members/past/degrees.md#master-thesis-by-year-conferred" >}}).
This list only starts from 2016, earlier thesis's maybe added at a later time.
The theses are in no particular order.
