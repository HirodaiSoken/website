# Website Image & Policies
* Simple structure （単純な構造）
* Readable code （読みやすいコード）
* Easy to maintain website （維持しやすい）

We plan to use a static site generator to accomplish those policies.  This way future focus is on Frontend and Content Management in markdown files.  While little changes for the backend HTML/CSS/JS.

# Todo
## Frontend Support & Content Management
* Make content for:
    * news (Auto generated from last 5 schedule/events)
        * could be separate pages compared to events
    * schedule/events is in JSON file.
        * New events need a markdown page created, for example 坂井さん award
    * member list
        * staff pages introduces research interests
    * access copy from old version
    * other ideas
* Update content
    * New homepage colors??
    * New homepage images
    * anything else design
* Maintain content
    * talk to staff and students about events/news.  Then update homepage.
## Backend Support
* Transfer to a hugo static site
    * Create our own theme using existing HTML/CSS/JS
* Many small issues
    * nav bar needs to be fixed
    * Pull more options from the HTML to the markdown files
    * Set up the Auto generation of past schedules in JSON
    * Japanese and English translations for the NAV bar, Footer, header are needed to be completed
